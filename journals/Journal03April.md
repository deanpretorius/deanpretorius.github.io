This is just a brain dump. This isn’t related to work. It is just my thoughts as they come. But staring at a blank page like this is quite intimidating. So it might just digress into a list of topics that are on my heart and that I am actively pondering on.

So to start off, if life Is defined about the ways that I am spending my time, I am quite a multi-faceted person. I work a 9-5 job at a government institution doing research as an electronic engineer. This covers most of my day but it scratches my itch for curiosity and is a cool place to implement ideas. The problem here is that I spend so much time go-go-going and moving. But unfortunately, I don’t take much time to reflect.

Reflecting has always been an intention of mine. I always tell myself that I am wanting to spend Friday afternoon’s just writing for fun. Documenting work projects, ideas, personal anecdotes, etc. On top of this, I am wanting to publish this writing. There is an edge that is removed. An aside, I am wanting to set this intention to give it an edge, but I realized that when I think about publishing something into the world the level of quality that I put into something that is a whole lot higher. But this isn’t just a me thing, this is something that I am beginning to realise is human nature. At first, these things won’t be a very glamorous. I am going to vibe code a website and host it using github pages, which I already set up. Hopefully I can be consistent with this and I make the time to prioritize this. Because I actually enjoy writing.

So I actually enjoy writing, but I tried journaling for the past few months using a pen and paper. But the intimidation of an empty page just scars me. It is waaay easier to let my fingers flow on a keyboard. So I think I will continue like this.

But besides work and writing, I have many other hobbies. There are so many things that are important to me. And writing them down will help me define the things that are important to my soul. Let me try to make sense of all this fog that is clouding my priority list. So lets brain dump all the stuff that I want in life. Gosh, there was a time when I wanted few things and that wasn’t too long ago. But now, I don’t even know where to start.

So what do I want.

I want to enjoy my parents getting old and my family growing. Being around them and celebrating their wines, and grieving their losses gives me so much purpose in life.

I want to be an astronaut. This goal has progressively become more and more clear to me. It inspired my choice to spend time doing the piloting license. So yeah, now I am doing a piloting license.

I want to secure the freedom to do the things that I actually choose to do. I believe that tapering my consumption is part of this equation. I do not want to consume unnecessary things in my life and I realise that everything that I consume that is not in alignment with anything on this list is almost wasted. So I want to reduce my consumption, and instead create the things that I think I need.

Reducing my consumption of unnecessary things will free up money (building up a habit of saving), and free up the time that I would have spent consuming the thing that I ultimately don’t want. So I have to then think about how I want to spend this excess time and money in ways that align with what I want.

Cool, with all this money that I am saving, I want to build this savings habit. Then begin investing the excess money. The savings habit will be exercised through building savings automation, which will redirect all the excess into investment accounts. Building up wealth to fund the things that I choose to do.

Then to spend the extra time I have I can let me creative, and learning juices flow. I have so many ideas that I want to implement. These ideas aren’t all for a monetary profit. But I want to spend my time with people I like, and doing things that I like. So I want to spend more and more time with my friends, I want to wake up next to Anwen, I want to stay healthy, I started brewing my own kombucha, I want to print my own T-shirts of a painting where I was the muse. I want to go on hikes. I want to attend festivals. I want a great sex life. I want to learn to become a pilot of pivot my career into some sort of propulsion/aviation. I want to travel, see the world, and run. I want Anwen by my side. I want status. I want to figure out what the 5 year old, 18 year old, and 21 year old Dean was inspired by and do those things so that I can look back at this time

This isn’t all my wants, and this list will probably grow. But it captures
