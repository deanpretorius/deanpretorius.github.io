<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>This is just a
brain dump. This isn’t related to work. It is just my thoughts as they come.
But staring at a blank page like this is quite intimidating. So it might just
digress into a list of topics that are on my heart and that I am actively
pondering on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>So to start off,
if life Is defined about the ways that I am spending my time, I am quite a
multi-faceted person. I work a 9-5 job at a government institution doing
research as an electronic engineer. This covers most of my day but it scratches
my itch for curiosity and is a cool place to implement ideas. The problem here
is that I spend so much time go-go-going and moving. But unfortunately, I don’t
take much time to reflect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Reflecting has
always been an intention of mine. I always tell myself that I am wanting to
spend Friday afternoon’s just writing for fun. Documenting work projects,
ideas, personal anecdotes, etc. On top of this, I am wanting to publish this
writing. There is an edge that is removed. An aside, I am wanting to set this
intention to give it an edge, but I realized that when I think about publishing
something into the world the level of quality that I put into something that is
a whole lot higher. But this isn’t just a me thing, this is something that I am
beginning to realise is human nature. At first, these things won’t be a very
glamorous. I am going to vibe code a website and host it using github pages,
which I  already set up. Hopefully I can be consistent with this and I make the
time to prioritize this. Because I actually enjoy writing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>So I actually
enjoy writing, but I tried journaling for the past few months using a pen and
paper. But the intimidation of an empty page just scars me. It is waaay easier
to let my fingers flow on a keyboard. So I think I will continue like this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>But besides work
and writing, I have many other hobbies. There are so many things that are
important to me. And writing them down will help me define the things that are
important to my soul. Let me try to make sense of all this fog that is clouding
my priority list. So lets brain dump all the stuff that I want in life. Gosh,
there was a time when I wanted few things and that wasn’t too long ago. But
now, I don’t even know where to start. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>So what do I 
want.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>I want to enjoy
my parents getting old and my family growing. Being around them and celebrating
their wines, and grieving their losses gives me so much purpose in life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>I want to be an
astronaut. This goal has progressively become more and more clear to me. It
inspired my choice to spend time doing the piloting license. So yeah, now I am
doing a piloting license.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>I want to secure
the freedom to do the things that I actually choose to do. I believe that
tapering my consumption is part of this equation. I do not want to consume
unnecessary things in my life and I realise that everything that I consume that
is not in alignment with anything on this list is almost wasted. So I want to reduce
my consumption, and instead create the things that I think I need. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Reducing my
consumption of unnecessary things will free up money (building up a habit of
saving), and free up the time that I would have spent consuming the thing that
I ultimately don’t want. So I have to then think about how I want to spend this
excess time and money in ways that align with what I want. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Cool, with all
this money that I am saving, I want to build this savings habit. Then begin
investing the excess money. The savings habit will be exercised through
building savings automation, which will redirect all the excess into investment
accounts. Building up wealth to fund the things that I choose to do. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Then to spend
the extra time I have I can let me creative, and learning juices flow. I have
so many ideas that I want to implement. These ideas aren’t all for a monetary
profit. But I want to spend my time with people I like, and doing things that I
like. So I  want to spend more and more time with my friends, I want to wake up
next to Anwen, I want to stay healthy, I started brewing my own kombucha, I
want to print my own T-shirts of a painting where I was the muse. I want to go
on hikes. I want to attend festivals. I want a great sex life. I want to learn
to become a pilot of pivot my career into some sort of propulsion/aviation. I
want to travel, see the world, and run. I want Anwen by my side. I want status.
I want to figure out what the 5 year old, 18 year old, and 21 year old Dean was
inspired by and do those things so that I can look back at this time </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>This isn’t all
my wants, and this list will probably grow. But it captures </span></p>
